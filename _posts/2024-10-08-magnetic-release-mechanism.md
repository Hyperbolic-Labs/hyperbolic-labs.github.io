Release Mechanism
--------------------------
After trying several ideas I had around a heater-based cutdown mechanism, it was clear that this approach just wasn't going to work reliably at low temperatures. The battery can only supply a limited amount of current, and I found that 1W of power just wasn't enough melt through a polymer-based balloon tether. A micro sized solenoid could work,but most weren't designed to operate from a single AA cell, and most significantly increased the total weight. The minimum energy required to release the balloon is relatively minimal, and most solenoids have way more pull strength than is necessary. Given these facts, I decided to come up with my own purpose-built magnetic release that weighs almost nothing and requires very little power to operate. To accomplish this I'll be using an unshielded inductor with a ferrite core, which is mounted to a flex PCB. The flexPCB has a long tab which gets folded into a loop with a small Neodymium magnet on the end. When current is run through the inductor, an opposing magnetic field is generated which repels the magnet, releasing the balloon.

This mechanism should be more reliable and only use a fraction of the energy used by the heater method. It's surprisingly difficult to search for unshielded inductors with the right geometry for this application, since shielded inductors are almost always superior. However, I found the LPO2506 series from Coilcraft to be nearly perfect. They're constructed from ceramic with an inner ferrite core which is about 5mm in diameter and an overall thickness of 1.5mm.

The magnetic specs aren't listed in the datasheet, but most ferrites saturate in the 0.25-0.4T range. This means by choosing a magnet with a similar flux density, the attraction force of the magnet can be roughly nullified by running the inductor near saturation. In addition, since the inductor will be pre-biased 'against' the field generated by the coil, it can be pushed past it's normal saturation current. This in turn means that not only will the magnet lose attraction to the ferrite, but it will actually see a repulsive force. Using the magnet calculator from K&J Magnetic's website, I calculated the surface flux density of a 5x2mm disc magnet to be ~0.25T.

This works out great, since this means the ferrite core will be just barely saturated in the opposite direction (or close to it). Assuming the core saturates at 0.25T, this means all we have to do is pass through the 'normal' (unbiased) saturation current through the inductor to bring the net field close to zero. By somewhat arbitrarily choosing the 220uH inductor from this series, the DC resistance is listed as 3.7ohms. Assuming a battery voltage of 1.0V this works out to 0.24A through the inductor, just barely past the listed saturation current. In short,when 1.0V is applied to the inductor, the attraction force of the magnet should be close to zero, releasing the balloon. Of significant importance is the consideration of maximum holding force this mechanism can withstand. 

K&J magnetics site also has a handy pull force calculator, and a 5x2mm disc magnet has an estimated axial pull strength of around 170g at 0.5mm distance. The shear pull strength of a magnet happens to be about half of its axial pull strength as detailed [here](https://www.kjmagnetics.com/blog.asp?p=shear-force). Assuming the core saturates at 0.25T, this magnetic attraction force should be able to withstand ~110g of vertical pull from the balloon (even without considering friction between magnet and inductor). I think this should be just enough margin for this mechanism to work without releasing inadvertently. There is one potential downside to this approach, that being the the inductor's cross sectional area. Total magnetic flux (and consequently maximum holding weight) is dictated by cross sectional area and core saturartion. This means that increasing the size or strength of the magnet will have no effect on holding strength. Moreover, it will only reduce the inductor's repulsion force by further shifting the bias field. Payloads over 100g would likely need to implement a larger custom core in order to work. Maybe in the future I'll experiment with PCB trace coils and a solid iron core for superior saturation characteristics.
